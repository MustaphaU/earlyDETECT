# earlyDETECT
Depression Detection System as part of a decision support tool. 

In this project we demonstrate a possible workflow for prescreening for depression based on a trained ML model and four features. We also provide possible explanation for the model's decision in terms of feature impact or contribution on every outcome. For each interpretation, we leverage LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations). After each inference, users can click on the visualization dropdown in the top right to view the LIME plots, Feature importance, and one of the decision trees.
